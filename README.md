# GuessNumber

The objective of the task was to implement the game GuessNumber.
The program implements exception handling and when the user enters a non-numeric value an appropriate message will appear, but the program will continue without terminating its operation. To handle the exception when the user enters a number but outside the range of 1-100, I used a conditional instruction with an appropriate message.
After 5 unsuccessful attempts to guess the drawn number, the program terminates its actions, providing the solution.
